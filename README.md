BME 252 Linear Signals &amp; Systems Group Project
This is a term project for the course BME 252 - Linear Signals & Systems where our group designed and developed MATLAB scripts that take multiple different audio files as input signals, process and filter the input sound signals by dividing them into several frequency bands (using Equiripple while evaluating between FIR and IIR filters), and then extract envelop. Finally, the output signal is generated by adding the normalized average of amplitude-modulated cosine signals that oscillate with the central frequency of each bandpass filter.
